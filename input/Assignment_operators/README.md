Challenge 1: Shorthand Updates
Objective: Utilize shorthand assignment operators to modify a variable's value.

Steps:

Initialize a variable named count with a value of 5.
Add 3: Update count by adding 3 using the += operator. Print the new value.
Subtract 2: Update count by subtracting 2 using the -= operator. Print the new value.
Multiply by 4: Update count by multiplying it by 4 using the *= operator. Print the new value.
Divide by 2: Update count by dividing it by 2 using the /= operator. Print the new value.


challenge 2 : Increment and Decrement
Objective: Explore the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators.

Steps:

Initialize two variables: x with a value of 10 and y with a value of 20.
Increment x: Increase x by 5 using the x += 5 operator (equivalent to x = x + 5). Print the updated value of x.
Decrement y: Decrease y by 3 using the y -= 3 operator (equivalent to y = y - 3). Print the updated value of y.

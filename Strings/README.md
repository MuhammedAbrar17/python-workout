Challenge 1: Working with Quotes and Multiline Strings
Write a program that uses double quotes to store a famous quote.

Then, write a program that uses triple quotes (either ''' or """) to create a multiline poem or paragraph. Print both the quote and the poem/paragraph.

Challenge 2: Concatenation Fun
Write a program that creates two variables: first_name and last_name. Concatenate them with a space in between to form a full name and print it.

Then, try a more elaborate concatenation: create a greeting message by combining a string literal with the full name variable.
